#' Evaluation module
#'
#' Takes as input the cluster memberships produced by a single run of `cluster_module`, and the
#' parameters used by `cluster_module`. Returns a list of evaluation metrics for that run of
#' `cluster_module`.
#'
#' @param x distance matrix
#' @param cvec numeric vector of length n with cluster memberships
#' @param parameter list of parameters used by `cluster_module`
#' @param supervised boolean indicating whether or not to use supervised learning as a metric of
#'   cluster quality
#' @return numeric vector of evaluation metrics including
#'   - Cohesiveness: Measures how tightly grouped points are within clusters.
#'   - Separation: Measures how distinct clusters are from each other.
#'   - Cluster Sizes: Number of data points in each cluster.
#'   - Other relevant clustering metrics depending on the implementation.
